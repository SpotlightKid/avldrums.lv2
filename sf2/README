These files were modified from the original .sf2 files from
http://www.bandshed.net/avldrumkits/

 - The panning was changed to match the layout as displayed on the images
   (hand-clap, maracas, tambourine)
 - silence was cut at the start of some samples
 - exclusive class groups were added for hi-hat and all cymbals.
